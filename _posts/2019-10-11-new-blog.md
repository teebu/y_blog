Hello Jekyll, goodbye Drupal. 

We are moving to a new blog. One of the cool things about Jekyll is it's hosted on github. Meaning, there will be almost no downtime.

Once everything is setup it, it's pretty easy to make a new post. It's as simple as creating a new file and committing it to your repo.
